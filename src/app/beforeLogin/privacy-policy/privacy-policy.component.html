                            When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone 
                            to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor,

                            in connection with the device hardware, data stored in 
                            connection with the device's operating system or other

                            A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a 
                            third party partner about how you browse and use the 
                            Service and may help us or others provide reports or 
                            personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service 
                            may not function properly if use or availability of device 
                            identifiers is impaired or disabled.

                <h6>Metadata:</h6>
                <ul>

                        <p>
                            Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. 
                            For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of 
                            User Content was collected and how that content is formatted.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content 
                            including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo), 
                            geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or other data. 
                            This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. 
                            If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, 
                            your latitude and longitude will be stored with the photo and searchable 
                            (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made public 
                            by you in accordance with your privacy settings.
