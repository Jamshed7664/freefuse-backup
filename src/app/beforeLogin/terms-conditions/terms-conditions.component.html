        <p>Welcome to FreeFuse!</p>
        <p>
            These Terms govern your use of FreeFuse and the products, features, apps, services, 
            technologies, and software we offer (the FreeFuse Products or Products), 
            except where we state that separate terms (and not these) apply.
        </p>

            <li>
                <strong>Our Services</strong> Our mission is to give people the power to build community 
                and bring the world closer together. To help advance this mission, we provide 
                the Products and services described below to you:
                
                <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Provide a personalized experience for you:</strong>
                            Your experience on FreeFuse is unlike anyone else’s: from the posts, stories, events, 
                            ads, and other content you see in News Feed or our video platform to the Pages you 
                            follow and other features you might use, such as Trending, Marketplace, and search. 
                            We use the data we have – for example, about the connections you make, the choices 
                            and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products – to 
                            personalize your experience.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Connect you with people and organizations you care about:</strong> 
                            We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organizations, 
                            and others that matter to you across the FreeFuse Products you use. 
                            We use the data we have to make suggestions for you and others – for example, 
                            groups to join, events to attend, Pages to follow or send a message to, shows to 
                            watch, and people you may want to become friends with. Stronger ties make for better 
                            communities, and we believe our services are most useful when people are connected to 
                            people, groups, and organizations they care about. 
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Empower you to express yourself and communicate about what matters to you:</strong>  
                            There are many ways to express yourself on FreeFuse and to communicate with friends, 
                            family, and others about what matters to you – for example, sharing status updates, 
                            photos, videos, and stories across the FreeFuse Products you use, sending messages 
                            to a friend or several people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile. 
                            We also have developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use technology, 
                            such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share more expressive and engaging 
                            content on FreeFuse.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Help you discover content, products, and services that may interest you:</strong>
                            We show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content to help you discover content, 
                            products, and services that are offered by the many businesses and organizations that 
                            use FreeFuse and other FreeFuse Products. Our partners pay us to show their content to you, 
                            and we design our services so that the sponsored content you see is as relevant and useful 
                            to you as everything else you see on our Products.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Combat harmful conduct and protect and support our community:</strong>  
                            People will only build community on FreeFuse if they feel safe. We employ dedicated teams around the
                            world and develop advanced technical systems to detect misuse of our Products, harmful conduct towards others, 
                            and situations where we may be able to help support or protect our community. If we learn of content 
                            or conduct like this, we will take appropriate action – for example, offering help, removing content, 
                            blocking access to certain features, disabling an account, or contacting law enforcement. We share data 
                            with other FreeFuse Companies when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using one of our Products.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Use and develop advanced technologies to provide safe and functional services for everyone:</strong>  
                            We use and develop advanced technologies – such as artificial intelligence, machine learning 
                            systems, and augmented reality – so that people can use our Products safely regardless of physical 
                            ability or geographic location. For example, technology like this helps people who have visual 
                            impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos shared on FreeFuse or Instagram. 
                            We also build sophisticated network and communication technology to help more people connect 
                            to the internet in areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems to improve our 
                            ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous activity that may harm our community and the 
                            integrity of our Products.

                            <strong>Research ways to make our services better:</strong>  
                            We engage in research and collaborate with others to improve our Products. 
                            One way we do this is by analyzing the data we have and understanding how people 
                            use our Products. You can learn more about some of our research efforts.

                            <strong>Provide consistent and seamless experiences across the FreeFuse Company Products:</strong>  
                            Our Products help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organizations, 
                            and others that are important to you. We design our systems so that your experience is 
                            consistent and seamless across the different FreeFuse Company Products that you use. 
                            For example, we use data about the people you engage with on FreeFuse to make it easier 
                            for you to connect with them on Instagram or Messenger, and we enable you to communicate 
                            with a business you follow on FreeFuse through Messenger.

                            <strong>Enable global access to our services:</strong>  
                            To operate our global service, we need to store and distribute content and 
                            data in our data centers and systems around the world, including outside your 
                            country of residence. This infrastructure may be operated or controlled by 
                            FreeFuse, Inc., FreeFuse Ireland Limited, or its affiliates.

                <strong>Our Data Policy and Your Privacy Choices</strong> To provide these services, 
                we must collect and use your personal data. We detail our practices in the Data Policy,

                    <li>
                        Who can use FreeFuse When people stand behind their opinions and actions, 
                        our community is safer and more accountable. For that reason, you must:
                        <ul style="list-style-type:disc; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                            <li>Use the same name that you use in everyday life.</li>
                            <li>Provide accurate information about yourself.</li>

                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        We try to make FreeFuse broadly available to everyone, but you cannot use FreeFuse if:

                        What you can share and do on FreeFuse We want people to use FreeFuse 
                        to express themselves and to share content that is important to them, 
                        but not at the expense of the safety and well-being of others or the 
                        integrity of our community. You therefore agree not to engage in the 
                        conduct described below (or to facilitate or support others in doing so):

                        </ul>

                        We can remove content you share in violation of these provisions and, if applicable, 
                        we may take action against your account, for the reasons described below. 
                        We may also disable your account if you repeatedly infringe other people’s intellectual property rights.

                        To help support our community, we encourage you to report content or conduct that you believe violates 
                        your rights (including intellectual property rights) or our terms and policies.

                                Permission to use content you create and share: You own the content you create 
                                and share on FreeFuse and the other FreeFuse Products you use, and nothing in 
                                these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are free to 
                                share your content with anyone else, wherever you want. To provide our services, 
                                though, we need you to give us some legal permissions to use that content.
                                <br>
                                <br>

                                    with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, 
                                    royalty-free, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run,

                                    of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). 
                                    This means, for example, that if you share a photo on FreeFuse, you give 
                                    us permission to store, copy, and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) 
                                    such as service providers that support our service or other FreeFuse Products you use.

                                    You should know that, for technical reasons, content you delete may persist 
                                    for a limited period of time in backup copies (though it will not be visible to other users). 
                                    In addition, content you delete may continue to appear if you have shared it with others 
                                    and they have not deleted it.

                                We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make our 
                                Products better for you and our community. As a result, we may need to update these 
                                Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices. 
                                Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you before we make changes to these 
                                Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. 
                                Once any updated Terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use our Products.

                                <br>
                                We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree to our updated 
                                Terms and no longer want to be a part of the FreeFuse community, you can delete your account at any time.

                                your account to protect our community and services, including by suspending access to your 
                                account or disabling it. We may also suspend or disable your account if you create risk or 
                                legal exposure for us or when we are permitted or required to do so by law. Where appropriate, 
                                we will notify you about your account the next time you try to access it. You can learn more

                                We work hard to provide the best Products we can and to specify clear guidelines 
                                for everyone who uses them. Our Products, however, are provided “as is,” and we 
                                make no guarantees that they always will be safe, secure, or error-free, or that 
                                they will function without disruptions, delays, or imperfections. To the extent 
                                permitted by law, we also DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OF IMPLIED, 
                                INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, 
                                TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not control or direct what people and others do or say, 
                                and we are not responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or

                                We cannot predict when issues might arise with our Products. Accordingly, our liability 
                                shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and under no circumstance 
                                will we be liable to you for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential,

                                Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these Terms or the FreeFuse Products will 
                                not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past twelve months.

                                We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us. 
                                If a dispute does arise, however, it’s useful to know up front where it can be resolved and what 
                                laws will apply.

                                resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California 
                                or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to the personal 
                                jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, 
                                and that the laws of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim, 
                                without regard to conflict of law provisions.

                                        make up the entire agreement between you and FreeFuse, Inc. regarding your

                                        Some of the Products we offer are also governed by supplemental terms. If you 
                                        use any of those Products, supplemental terms will be made available and will 
                                        become part of our agreement with you. For instance, if you access or use our 
                                        Products for commercial or business purposes, such as buying ads, selling 
                                        products, developing apps, managing a group or Page for your business, or using 
                                        our measurement services, you must agree to our Commercial Terms. If you post or 
                                        share content containing music, you must comply with our Music Guidelines. 
                                        To the extent any supplemental terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental 
                                        terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict.

                                        If any portion of these Terms are found to be unenforceable, the remaining 
                                        portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to enforce any of 
                                        these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver 
                                        of these Terms must be made in writing and signed by us.
